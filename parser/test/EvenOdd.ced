module EvenOdd.

{- for now, mutually inductive types will have parameters and a kind
listed only for the first one, as the others (dubbed "subsidiary") are
required (at the moment) to have the same parameters and kind.

This is implemented in the parser, so we do not list parameters or kind
with Odd below. -}
